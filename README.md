# benohaal.github.io

This little project is the result of an assignment for the computational geometry course of my master program at ULB (Brussels).
The files are supposed to be installed (pushed) onto a github repository with Github Pages enabled. 
The page should be set up with the Leap-day Jekyll theme. Doing so will automatically create the webpage for you once the content has been committed.
The javascript content of the webpage has been embedded from Codesandbox.io. It uses the p5.js library for all the drawings. 
The index.md file basically contains the whole content of the project and should be readable from any Markdown file reader (except for the embedded JS). 
"index.md" acts as a report of the work done.
