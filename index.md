title: Watchman Route Problem
---

### Abstract
The watchman route problem is an optimization problem related to the famous art gallery problem. The problem is the following.
Given a simple polygon, we want to find the shortest (closed) route such that any point inside the polygon is visible from at least one point of the route.
This website contains all the definitions needed to apprehend the problem, aswell as simple-ish approximation algorithm to find a good solution to the problem.
