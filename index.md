title: Watchman Route Problem
---

**Notes:** 
- This is a work in progress that should however give you an idea of the structure the project will take. 
- The subject ended up being way more complicated to approach than I expected, hence I spent a lot of time looking for articles and finding "the right one"
- The project is based on the following paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439750700463X?via%3Dihub, regarding a linear-time 2-approximation algorithm for simple polygons

### Abstract
The watchman route problem is an optimization problem related to the famous art gallery problem. The problem is the following.
Given a simple polygon, we want to find the shortest (closed) route such that any point inside the polygon is visible from at least one point of the route.
This website contains all the definitions needed to apprehend the problem, aswell as simple-ish approximation algorithm to find a good solution to the problem.
